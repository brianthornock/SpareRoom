# SpareRoom

The Spare Room is a compact, PT2399-based reverb designed for a 1590a enclosure. Because the PCB is only slightly larger than the potentiometer footprint, it also makes a great standalone reverb module for small amps, multi-effects boxes, etc. A full explanation of the circuit is available at https://scientificguitarist.wixsite.com/home/spare-room.
